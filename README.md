Hello, my name is Arian Kharazmi. 
I am a student at the University of Cincinnati and I am a Senior student currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology - (Software Application Development) and an MSc (or PhD) degree in Computer Science.

I am pursuing a career in tech because I have always wanted to use technology for the ability to push communities forward
and change someone’s life you don’t even know for the better. 
I want to be involved in the decisions that can help our world progress forward. 
My hope is to give back in some way, shape or form.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on several projects and trying to learn as much as possible!
- 🌱 I’m currently self-learning Python and diving into the world of AI and LLMs/RAGs.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on IT-CS related projects and repositories.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with becoming more knowledgeable about ML/Transformers
- 💬 Ask me about anything technology-related.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email, text, LinkedIn!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have once flown on a flight with a U.S Supreme Court Justice.
