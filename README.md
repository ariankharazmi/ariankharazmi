Hello, my name is Arian Kharazmi. 
I am a student at the University of Cincinnati and I am a Senior student currently pursuing a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Information Technology - (Software Application Development) and an MSc (or PhD) degree in Computer Science.

I am pursuing a career in tech because I have always wanted to use technology for the ability to push communities forward
and change someone‚Äôs life you don‚Äôt even know for the better. 
I want to be involved in the decisions that can help our world progress forward. 
My hope is to give back in some way, shape or form.

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on several projects and trying to learn as much as possible!
- üå± I‚Äôm currently self-learning Python and diving into the world of AI and LLMs/RAGs.
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on IT-CS related projects and repositories.
- ü§î I‚Äôm looking for help with becoming more knowledgeable about ML/Transformers.
- ‚ôüÔ∏è Trying to get better at Chess!
- üìñ Reading Introduction to Statistical Learning.
- üí¨ Ask me about anything technology-related.
- üì´ How to reach me: Email, text, LinkedIn!
- üòÑ Pronouns: He/Him
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I have once flown on a flight with a U.S Supreme Court Justice.
