### Hi!👋

Hello, my name is Arian Kharazmi. 
I am a student at the University of Cincinnati and I am a Junior student currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology. 

I am pursuing a career in IT/CS because I have always wanted to use technology for the ability to push communities forward
and change someone’s life you don’t even know for the better. 
I want to be involved in the decisions that can help our world progress forward. 
My dream is to someday have my own tech start-up company.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on self teaching Python and learning about about microcontrollers. I want to understand more about Python and microcontrollers (Pi/Arduino).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 3 and Swift, perhaps C++ after.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on more IT related projects and repositories.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting better with Python.
- 💬 Ask me about technology.
- 📫 How to reach me: email.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I would love to go skydiving.



--> That is pretty much it. Thanks for visiting my page!
